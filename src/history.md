When Balsa Man first began in 2008, it was nothing more than a dream, a badly done wooden figure, and some cheap lighter fluid. This dinky janky figure and it’s tiny flame fueled a huge bonfire of joy for literally dozens of people! As the years went by, the Balsa Man got more and more refined and more and more people came — not only to experience but also to participate by making their own tiny art! Soon regional Balsa Man events sprouted up around the world!

Each year, the Balsa Man founder, Colin Fahrion, and all the amazing staff of Balsa Man strove to add a new creative twist to the event. Of course, like any art event it had its share of controversies too — like the ticket fiasco of 2011 and the dramatic relocation of the event in 2012. However, all the participants who braved these hurdles walked away transformed in some tiny magical way.

## Balsa Man 2011

**Growing Pains!** After the explosion of attendees the Balsa Man org starts selling tickets for the first time — which was a bit of a fiasco. Make sure to check out the [2011 edition of Dress Warm](https://balsaman.org/dresswarm/dresswarm.pdf)!

## Balsa Man 2012

**Chance!** In trying to manage the ticket fiasco of last year Balsa Man org held Balsa Man Bingo and Three Card Monte events for participants to get tickets. This was the last year of Balsa Man which was held at a new location due to polite request from the federal park service.

## Balsa Man 2013

**Flotsam & Jetsam!** This year marked the year of letting go. There was no official event this year. The Balsa Man Org disbanded and encouraged Balsa Burners to see this not as an end but a beginning. We encouraged all to take the spirit and creativity of Balsa Man and forge their own events!

## Balsa Man 2020

At the beginning of 2020, the [Oakland Museum of California](https://museumca.org/) hosted a special Balsa Man 2020 event as part of thier [No Spectators: The Art of Burning Man](https://museumca.org/exhibit/no-spectators-art-burning-man) exhibit. It was a smashing success! Black Pebble City grew throughout the day thanks to people of all ages and sizes who participated by making tiny art to fill out the city! From teeny tents to puny porto-potties to balsa sculptures of all types to tiny mutant vehicles!

A big thanks also goes out to the volunteers who helped make it happen! The Balsa Man KCrew labored away to build the Man. The Dept of Tiny Works helped lay out the streets and put up the tiny trash fence. And the Artery helped run the art workshop and helped tiny artists find the perfect place for their work in Black Pebble City.

Also, of course, a big thanks to the Oakland Museum of California for their support in bringing back Balsa Man one last time!
