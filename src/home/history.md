When Balsa Man first began in 2008, it was nothing more than a dream, a badly built wooden figure, and some cheap lighter fluid. This dinky janky figure and it’s tiny flame fueled a huge bonfire of joy for literally dozens of participants, several of whom brought their own tiny art! As the years went by, the Balsa Man got more refined and the event became slighty bigger with more tiny art! Soon regional Balsa Man events sprouted up around the world!

Each year, the Balsa Man founder, Colin Fahrion, and all the amazing staff of Balsa Man strove to add a new creative twist to the event. Of course, like any art event it had its share of controversies — like the ticket fiasco of 2011 and the dramatic relocation of the event in 2012. However, all the participants who braved these hurdles walked away transformed in a minuscule magical way.
