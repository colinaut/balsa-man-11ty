Balsa Man is a small 1/16th scale art event that began 2008 in San Francisco. While the visual centerpiece is the balsa "Man", the creative core of the event was always the joyfully participatory community around it! The Balsa Man founder encouraged people to dream big with their tiny art!

The small scale is key to what made Balsa Man accessible. Tiny art can be made with minimal materials by anyone regardless of their age or "artistic skill". The main event itself was purposefully micro-ephemeral, lasting only couple hours, ending with a brief burn of the art.

Regional Balsa Man events have popped up all over: San Diego, Boston, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, London, Tokyo, and more! Each with their own unique spin â€” London Balsa Blightly had a Balsa Big Ben!

While Balsa Man founder has hung up his X-acto knives, that doesn't mean the spirit of Balsa Man is dead. We encourage anyone to be inspired and create their own tiny event!
