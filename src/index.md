## History of Balsa Man

Balsa Man is a small 1/16th scale art event that started in San Francisco, CA in 2008. Regional Balsa Man events have appeared all over the world â€” from Boston to Minneapolis to San Diego to London to Tokyo! In 2013, the founder of Balsa Man, Colin Fahrion, decided to put down his X-Acto knives to focus on other projects.

In 2020, Balsa Man was brought back one last time for a special event at the [Oakland Museum of California](https://museumca.org/)!
