Announcing the Balsa Man 2010 Placement Map for Tiny Art & Theme Camps!

Due to the record number of tiny art stomping incidents last year, Balsa Man 2010 will have a **Deep Playa Protected Art Area** fenced off to protect from the potential danger of participant feet. Also this allows for a better viewing of all the tiny art on display! Tiny artists are still allowed to place their art in the **Inner Playa Stomping Grounds**, but should do so at their own risk.

Speaking of Tiny Art, the [Black Pebble Arts Foundation](https://balsaman.org/donate/) is eager to see your [Tiny Art Grant Proposals](https://balsaman.org/tiny-art-grants/)! Send them in today!
