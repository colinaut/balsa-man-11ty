[![Craigslist Counterfeit Balsa Man Ticket](/images/3p53o23l65T45Z65S0a8a2a76b5b8da1e1cfc.jpg "Craigslist Counterfeit Balsa Man Ticket")](https://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/tix/1891887215.html)

Looks like our previous post about [counterfeit Balsa Man tickets](https://balsaman.org/2010/08/counterfeit-tickets/) don't reach out to enough people. We've unfortunately found [two](https://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/tix/1890393449.html) [people](https://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/wan/1884138769.html) on craigslist who didn't get the message and are looking for Balsa Man tickets.

More alarming we ran across [**one scammer**](https://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/tix/1891887215.html) trying to hoodwink the small minded by selling an obvious counterfeit ticket (see photo).

Also, in our search, we found someone looking for a [ride to Balsa Man](https://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/trv/1891983616.html)—_we do recommend ride sharing_.

_**Remember folks**_ THERE ARE NO BALSA MAN TICKETS. Balsa Man is purely DONOR SUPPORTED.

## Truly Support Tiny Art Through Donations

I know that the utter amazingness of the Balsa Man event can seem unbelievable at times. With all the hucksters online it's hard to know what to believe these days.

However, **know this**: we truly do use the proceeds from donations and the sale of [patchs](https://balsaman.org/goods/#patch2010), [stickers](https://balsaman.org/goods/#sticker2010), and [engraved x-acto boxes](https://balsaman.org/goods/#xactoset) to support tiny artists…

- **Every Donor** get's an official letter of donor recognition and a gift depending on their level of donation (see [donor award gifts](https://balsaman.org/donate/#donoraward))
- **Every Tiny Artist** who is awarded a grant is sent a letter of confirmation along with their grant award money and a gift of a Balsa Man sticker (see [tiny art grants](https://balsaman.org/tiny-art-grants/#tinyartgrants)).
- Donations also pay for materials and supplies for **[Tiny Art Build Parties](https://balsaman.org/category/tiny-art-build-party/).**
- **The BPAF Art Grant budget relies on you the donor to support tiny art.** The more you donate the more tiny art we can support!

[![Balsa Man 2010 Patch](/images/4861759624_065f581b69_z.jpg "Balsa Man 2010 Patch")](https://balsaman.org/goods/#patch2010)Remember _last year there was such a high demand for patches that we ran out a couple weeks prior to the event_. This year, we made more swank limited edition patches but we still expect to run out and once they run out we won't make any more. So to get yours [**donate today**](https://balsaman.org/donate/)!

Tonight, the BPAF will be mailing out all art grant awards and the gift packages to all the donors who've given thus far. If you donate today your gift package will be included in this shipment; next shipment won't be until next week.
