Balsa Man was a tiny bit better last year. Don't go.

I hear the beach can be chilly and there's sand everywhere and the whole place is overrun with seagulls and screaming children and tourists. Besides, in this economy I can't afford to spend $2 on MUNI let alone take time off from my job at Costco Soulmate Trading Outlet. Wait! What do you say? You can't afford to take time off from the DPW/Rangers/Cafe/Lamplighters/Temple/DOOM RAVE/Gate Crew either? And you can't find a babysitter for your sparklepony OR a ride to San Francisco OR a pair of pants? Well, perfect!

While everyone on Baker Beach is buttoning up their parkas and fumbling with their thermal underwear we'll throw our own Balsa Man in the Black Rock Desert. Let's say, **5pm on Friday September 2nd** **at Costco Soulmate Trading Outlet**? It's a deal. You bring the tiny toothpick art and I'll bring the flamethrower. See you at Funeral and 8:45!
