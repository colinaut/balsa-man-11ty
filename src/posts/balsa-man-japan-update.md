[Balsa Man Japan](http://www.burninja.info/balsaman) is nearly here! This Sunday August 29th the lil guy burns. As you can see, Maki and her crew the built an amazing creation.

It's shaping up to be a don't miss event—and sadly since BART doesn't yet have a Tokyo station, I won't be there. If you are planning on going make sure to review the [Balsa Man Japan Tiny Map](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ijinden/4921888906/in/pool-1462959@N24/) and read the [Balsa Man Japan Survival Guide](http://translate.google.com/translate?js=y&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&layout=1&eotf=1&u=http://www.burninja.info/balsaman/survival.htm&sl=auto&tl=en). Some wonderful tiny art and minute vehicles are going to be there, check out the photos below (more photos are on the [Balsa Man Japan Flickr Group](http://www.flickr.com/groups/1462959@N24/pool/with/4921888906/).
