After the huge success of last year's first Balsa Opera, we were overjoyed to receive notice that Fred Rinne is bringing his magic back to Balsa Man 2011! Sunshine was so touched by last year's opera that she cried.

It is will unreserved glee that we unanimously voted to grant **Fred Rinne** his full grant request of **$5.00** for the **Balsa Man Opera Kunstgruppe**! Fred Rinne will also be granted a complimentary Balsa Man Sticker and 5 tickets for Balsa Man for his acting troupe.
