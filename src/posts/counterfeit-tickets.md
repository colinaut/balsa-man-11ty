As you know, **Balsa Man is a [donation-supported event](http://balsaman.org/donate/ "BLACK PEBBLE ARTS FOUNDATION :: DONATE")**, which means _**we don't sell tickets**_. Nevertheless we've heard secondhand reports of counterfeit tickets circulating, some of them featuring full-color art and flawless microprinting depicting the Balsa Man statue in _flagrante inferno_.

Below is one of the better counterfeit tickets we've come across.

If you encounter any more of these counterfeit tickets **don't buy them, but please send us photos** because they sound freaking awesome!
