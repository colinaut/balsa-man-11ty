The BPAF knows that many of you do not like PayPal for a number of reasons. This is why we have added WePay as a method to donate to help support tiny art at Balsa Man.

You can donate via WePay using your bank account or a credit card using the button below. Note that the same [donor award levels](https://balsaman.org/donate) apply so you will get stickers and patches according to your donation level.

**IMPORTANT:** Saturday Aug 28th at 6pm is the cut off date if you want your donor awards delivered prior to the main event. We will still ship awards for donations after this date but we cannotÂ guarantee that you will get them in time.
