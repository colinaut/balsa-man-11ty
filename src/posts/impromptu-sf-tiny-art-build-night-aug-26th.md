Billfrog is having an impromptu Tiny Art Build Night on Thursday, 9pmish and on, at [The Sycamore](http://www.thesycamoresf.com/), 2140 Mission (between 17th & 18th). He encourages any and all to show up with their tiny art projects to build out on the back patio. Even if you have no Balsa Man projects feel free to stop by, grab a drink, and mingle with the tiny artists!

It's not an official Tiny Art Build Night so it's BYOBalsa and tools. A BPAF representative may or may not make an appearance depending on their schedule—it's getting awfully close to the event!
