This year is the year that the tiny spirit of Balsa Man goes global with regionals happening around this small blue marble called Earth!

## Tokyo Balsa Regional

[![Makibee - Tokyo Balsa Regional Lead](/images/Maki-TokyoRegionalLead.jpg "Makibee - Tokyo Balsa Regional Lead")](https://balsaman.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Maki-TokyoRegionalLead.jpg)Leading the effort to bring a small bit of joy across the Pacific pond is the amazing [**Makibee**](https://twitter.com/Makibee), a Freelance art-loving ex-mountain guide who just gave birth to 2nd generation Black Rock Desert camper! Makibee also runs #BURNINJA, a community of people in Japan who love camping in the Black Rock Desert… _why they would come all the way to the United States to camp in a dry, dusty and dull desert I have no idea._ No matter what their camping habits are, I can't say how thrilled we all are at the Balsa Man headquarters that Makibee is heading up the Tokyo Balsa Regional! Japan very well seems to be full of people who have mastered the art of tiny and cute 10 times over, so I can't wait to see the minuscule masterpieces that are sure to be born at their Balsa Burn.

More information about the Tokyo Balsa Regional will be forthcoming. If you have any questions or would like to volunteer or make tiny art for the regional you can contact Makibee at [balsajapan@balsaman.org](mailto:balsajapan@balsaman.org)

## London Balsa Regional

[![Miss Cheeky London Regional Lead](/images/MissCheeky-LondonRegionalLead.jpg "Miss Cheeky London Regional Lead")](https://balsaman.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/MissCheeky-LondonRegionalLead.jpg)Across the Atlantic Pond we have the marvelous [**Miss Cheeky**](https://www.flickr.com/photos/cheekypics/), a veteran Black Rock Desert camper herself… _what is it about Balsa Man that attracts all these desert campers?_ Anyways, besides being a person who likes to camp where it's dry she is an avid Roller Derby girl with the [London Rollergirls](https://www.londonrollergirls.com/) and crafter of adorable yet [slightly creepy dolls](https://www.flickr.com/photos/cheekypics/4734677875/)—correction, Miss Cheeky is a specialist and only crafts doll faces. With her creative crafting skills I know she''ll be able to make a pint-sized wonder of an Balsa event! And with her roller derby moxie, she's more than tough enough to handle any can kick all the riffraff out no matter how big they are.

More information about the London Balsa Regional will be forthcoming. If you have any questions or would like to volunteer or make tiny art for the regional you can contact Makibee at [balsalondon@balsaman.org](mailto:balsalondon@balsaman.org)
