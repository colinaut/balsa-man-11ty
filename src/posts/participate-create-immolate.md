Support for the [Black Pebble Arts Foundation](http://balsaman.org/donate) is taking off at a breakneck pace.  Many thanks to everybody who has donated!

We had a fabulous donation of $20 from [@edrabbit](http://www.twitter.com/edrabbit) (member of [Interpretive Arson](http://www.interpretivearson.com) and creator of a [miniature](http://www.flickr.com/photos/edrabbit/sets/72157607027550136/) [Dance Dance Immolation](http://www.interpretivearson.com/projects/ddi) for last year's [inaugural Balsa Man](http://balsaman.org/2009/07/what-is-balsa-man/)). This year, he hopes that his donation might fund an artist to create a miniature version of [2πr](http://www.interpretivearson.com/projects/2pir). We have also heard from a few artists already who are interested in creating tiny art, but we have yet to receive any formal grant requests. Participation is what makes Balsa Man grand so send us your art proposals!

_Oh, come on. You know you wanna build something._ Become inspired and then head on over to [Tiny Art & Grants](http://balsaman.org/tiny-art-grants/) to read our [Tiny Art Guidelines](http://balsaman.org/tiny-art-grants/#tinyartguidelines) on how to apply for a [Tiny Art Grant](http://balsaman.org/tiny-art-grants/#tinyartgrants).

Remember, this year's Balsa Man theme is "Big Dreams Writ Small" — art on a scale manageable to all. Your art project can be a wholely new creation that has never seen the light of day, or it can be based on art already baptised by alkali dust. Above all, your art should inspire YOU; art which you would love create on a grand scale but cannot. Take your inspiration, miniturize it, and bring it to Balsa Man…

and then set it on fire…

or not. _While we do enjoy fire, we understand that not all art must be set aflame to be meaningful._
