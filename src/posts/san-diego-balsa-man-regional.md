We hear at Balsa Man Org is overwhelmingly excited to announce that the excellent **[Angelica Aguilar](https://twitter.com/#!/argosXIII)** has volunteered to head up San Diego's first Balsa Man Regional! Angelica is a multi-talented Ecologist, SFX artist, and geek, and a totally bad-assed hoop dancer.

_And here she is to announcing the San Diego Balsa Regional in her own words…_

San Diego will be hosting it's very first Balsa Man event on **Saturday, Sept. 3 at 5:30pm**.  The event will take place at one of the **bonfire pits on Fiesta Island** (look for the pit with the Balsa Man!).  This year's man will be 2.5 feet tall, with a fire pit as the base, to celebrate one of San Diego's favorite summer past times.  The man will burn 7pm, just before sunset.

We look forward to all the tiny art that the community will bring.  Please remember that the burning of artwork, along with cleanup, is the responsibility of the artist.  However, because the man base is a fire pit, we will also permit tiny art to be thrown in after the man falls.  We have a couple tiny DJ sets lined up already, and will have supplies available with which to make tiny s'mores!

More information can be found on the [Facebook event page](https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=122450634518545 "San Diego Balsa Man Regional Facebook event page"). If you would like to get involved or have questions about the regional you can email [balsaSD@balsaman.org](mailto:balsaSD@balsaman.org).
