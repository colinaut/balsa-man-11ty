Are your Xactos sharp? Is your glue ready to stick? Got wood?

Actually I don't care what your answer is come anyway, even if you only have an ounce of an idea and not a scrap of balsa. Supplies will be provided as will the creative spirit! You may walk away inspired or just have fun lending a hand to other tiny artists trying to realize their small dream.

This art party is welcome to Tiny Artists who are attending the main event or the Black Rock Balsa Regional. The [Black Rock Regional Lead, Feral](http://balsaman.org/2011/08/balsa-man-black-rock-regional-2011/) will be there if you have any questions about the regional or if just want to congratulate her!
