The BPAF is proud to announce their first ever $30 grant! This is the largest tiny art grant the BPAF has ever handed out in the long history of Balsa Man. This was a contentious decision to award such a large grant but everyone on the committee felt **Slighty Impolite Awakening** was such a politically cogent work given the current oil disaster hitting the Mexican Gulf. Also, at 2 feet tall it is relatively large project. In the end, the vote was locked in by the fact that everyone was smitten with the word "SPLODEY!"

Congratulations **Matt Whatley** for being awarded for your full art grant request of **$30** ($20 for construction and $10 for SPLODEY)!
