We heard through the grape vine that this year the [Black Rock Balsa Regional](http://balsaman.org/2010/07/black-rock-balsa-regional-2010-sept-3rd/) won't be the only art project entertaining those desert campers. It seems that our small project has inspired others to also embrace the idea of making art out there on the Black Rock Desert—rather than just sit around staring at the mirages and dust devils. The one project we heard about seems cut directly from our own small artistic stock: [Tiny Tropolis](http://www.tinytropolis.com/), 100 dioramas, each containing a small unique work of art by a tiny artist. Their box dimensions (12" x 12" x 8") are a tad large, as such the BPAF can't support their efforts.

Lo and behold, but what did the BPAF get in the mail but a grant request from **J.D. & Logan** for Tiny Tropolis's smaller cousin **Teeny Tropolis**! No worries about supporting a project that was too large for their box dimensions are a wee 3.2 x 1.4 x 1.5 cm. Also we all applaud their choice of postcard—they really know how to stab into our hearts!

Congratulations J.D. & Logan for your grant award of **$2**! Unfortunately, none of the BPAF Art grant committee had the two dollar bill you specifically requested, but we will send your grant along as soon as we get one.
