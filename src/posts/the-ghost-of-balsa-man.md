We received the following digital tiny art grant request. While we of course prefer postcards, this art project was too endearing not to honor:

> "we and our 1/3 scale son would like to bring **The Ghost of the Balsa Man**. He will be made of straws and tissue paper and can fly after the man burn, aided in flight by balloons. We'd like enough for helium to fill balloons to raise the man.
> 
> **achemical and baby bot**"

One thing that worries us about this project is that the [world's supply of Helium is running out](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VN2-_5y_Vvw). But we overcame our worriesâ€”it is only a wafer thin amount of helium. Not knowing how much it costs to fill balloons, we decided to award a grant of **$8** to match the width of the project.
