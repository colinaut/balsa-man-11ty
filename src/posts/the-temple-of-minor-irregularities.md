In this era of 140-character limit ubiquity, we need ways to commemorate our most fleeting of thoughts, our passing interests, our Tweets of Fancy.

One of the most wonderfully and thematically underwhelming experiences of last year's Balsa Man event was the [Temple of Reduced Expectations](https://www.vimeo.com/1641121). The tradition of a temple to commemorate your Ritalin-addled attention span returns this Balsa Man Tiny Art Festival 2009.

## An irregular temple for an irregular event

[![Temple of Tiny Irregularities](/images/tiny-temple.jpg "Temple of Tiny Irregularities")](https://balsaman.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/tiny-temple.jpg)No longer part of a complete puzzle, the pieces used to create the Temple of Minor Irregularities come from all manner of puzzle boxes—each with a different story and background. Separate from their box, they no longer have a predetermined place to fit in. Each now an irregular piece, yet no more irregular than the next. The Temple becomes their home; a place that is more than a sum of its irregular parts much like the Balsa Man community.

Or I could be a huge art fag, and this is just a bunch of cardboard with puzzle pieces glued to it. **I dunno, it's art**. _You_ choose.

### What does the Temple Mean to YOU?

Sacred spaces the world over are places for people to commune with forces beyond their understanding. Ideas larger than what we can logically fathom take physical form in these temples, churches, holy landmarks and places of pilgrimages.

This Temple is no different in function, just in form.

And stature… Well, and longevity.

We invite you to make an offering to the Temple of Minor Irregularities, and to the diminutive dieties you revere!

### How do I send my **Post-It Prayer**?

1. Find a Sticky Note pad from one of the Temple Team, or bring your own.
2. Ensure your miniature mantras contain **no more than 140 characters**.
3. Fold up your Post-It Prayer, and put it in the Temple at the appointed time.
4. Achieve some small comfort as the Puny Pantheon sends your Post-It Prayer up in flames.

## The Tiny Temple Team needs your help!

The lead architects for this year's tiny temple are [Amy Diva](https://twitter.com/netdiva) and [Steve Gonzales](https://twitter.com/oznog), skilled artists who have worked on several amazing projects including the magnificent [Crude Awakening](https://www.headlesspoint.com/crude_awakening/).

In order to make this year's temple a reality they are asking for two things:

1. _**Donate your old jigsaw puzzles**_ to the Temple Team! _Red and yellow pieces are highly prized._
2. **_Volunteer to help glue!_**

The Temple Team  are wonderful folks, and would love to make your acquaintance while gluing your collective fingers together into a huge Gordian knot of phalanges. For more info contact the Temple Team at [**temple@balsaman.org**](mailto:temple@balsaman.org)
