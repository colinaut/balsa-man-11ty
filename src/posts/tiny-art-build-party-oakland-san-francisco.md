[![](/images/3846893558_e553b0d5b1.jpg "Balsa remains")](http://www.flickr.com/photos/headlouse/3846893558/in/set-72157622113746470/)The first tiny art build party was such a success with so much tiny creative spirit that we have decided to do two more this weekend: One in **Oakland on Saturday Aug 29th from noon to 7pm** and another in **San Francisco on Sunday Aug 30th from noon to 7pm**.

_This party is open to tiny artist going to either Balsa Man or the [Balsa Man Regional in Black Rock Desert](http://balsaman.org/2009/08/balsa-man-comes-to-the-black-rock-desert/), NV._
