The [Black Pebble Arts Foundation](http://balsaman.org/donate/) couldn't continue to function if it wasn't for there continual supply of caffeine whether it's in the form of coffee, yerba mate, tea—I swear one of our members would keel over if she didn't have her morning "Big Skull 'O Tea."

That's why when **Nina Rock** sent in her proposal for the **Balsa Man Cafe**, we all promptly took a swig from our respective mugs and nodded silently in agreement. This project has to go forward! Without a place to fuel up on caffeine at Balsa Man, I have no idea how the members of BPAF would last the entire two and a half hour long event. For the Balsa Man Cafe, BPAF awards a grant of **$10**, which should buy a bag of beans of at least decent quality.

In our jittery enthusiasm to approve the Balsa Cafe, we almost didn't notice that Nina Rock had included not one but two art grant proposals! Her second proposal, the **Milk Bar Box Theatre**, sounds like quite the fun project. Admittedly, not all of the art grant review committee were as brewing with ardor for this project; then, finally one member said "_come on guys, it's got LEDs_" and thus the committee voted to award it a grant of **$5**.

Thank you Nina Rock for making coffee & tiny art happen! And thanks to the donors for helping fill everyone's mugs at Balsa Man!
