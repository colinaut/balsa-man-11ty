After receiving this grant proposal, we asked all the scientists we knew if squids could dream. The first said, "how would I know I'm a physicist?" and the second said,"I don't know I just study their optical neuron pathways."

Getting nowhere we decided this was a question outside the bounds of science so we asked Sunshine, our resident expert onÂ anything not having anything to do with science. She replied that "Of course squid can dream! The squid here was likely compensating for feelings of inferiority by appearing gigantic in it's dream."

So there you have it, a squid with an inferiority complex. How could we not give a tiny art grant to such a beast?
