The [Black Pebble Arts Foundation](http://balsaman.org/donate/) was overjoyed to receive this ambitious proposal for a Tiny Art Car: **Lil Contessa** — It's a ship! It's a car! It's both and more!

The moment we saw the proposal, every member of the grants review committee was struck by warm waves of déjà vu. While no member could place their finger on the origin of the déjà vu, we all were certain that it had to be awarded a grant!

We are proud to award [**Joseph Hren**](http://www.artdork.org/) and his Tiny Art Car, **Lil Contessa** our largest award yet of **$15!**
