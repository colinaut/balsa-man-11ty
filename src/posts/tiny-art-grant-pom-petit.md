The Black Pebble Arts Foundation arts review committee would like to apologize to our donors. This grant was awarded while we were out. We're not really even sure who awarded it, but the papers were signed and the grant letter was put in the post before we could do anything about it.

Bill Clinton and a grant proposal for a miniature version of "the Belgium Waffle?" Who knows what this means—as if there was only one belgium waffle in all of existence.

Well at least we're only down **$2**. Congratulations, **Crash**! I can't wait to see your "**Pom Petit**" belgium waffle—really, we are overjoyed that you will be making art for Balsa Man.
