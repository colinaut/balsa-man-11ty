Bats, red wine, Bela Legosi, and Austin, Texas. A strange combination for sure but certainly an interesting one: **Toothpick's Vampire Bar**.

The committee was divided on this one. First off, the BPAF has never before awarded an art grant for a bar before, and this was especially an issue here since the request was unapologetically for the "_finest libations Trader Joe's can offer_." Secondly, we don't know how old this **Douglas Worley** is, for all we knew he's some twilight emo kid and we could get in trouble for encouraging underaged drinking.

In the end, the BPAF decided award the grant on both it's merit's and it's novelty being the first grant we've ever gotten from Austin, Texas. However, we are only awarding it only for purchase of toothpicks, which we did a search for and you can buy a [pack of 2500 craft toothpicks](https://www.walmart.com/ip/THE-CHENILLE-KRAFT-COMPANY-Flat-Wood-Toothpicks-2-500-per-Pack/14867681?sourceid=1500000000000003260370&ci_src=14110944&ci_sku=14867681) for $1.82 on Walmart.com. Also, since we think you're a nice kid, we'll toss in another couple bucks so you can buy a juice box—bringing your total grant award to **$3.82**!

Congratulations Douglas! I'm sure your Toothpick Vampire Bar will be the best vampire bar on la playa! Oh and try not to [sparkle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78it8A9wOXw) too much, it creates a lot of moop.
