If you're looking for a tiny replica of the [World's Largest Can of Spinach](https://www.worldslargestthings.com/arkansas/spinachcan.htm), [Carhenge](https://www.worldslargestthings.com/mobilemuseum.htm), or [Babe the Blue Ox](https://www.worldslargestthings.com/minnesota/babe.htm), look no further than [The World's Largest Collection of the World's Smallest Versions of the World's Largest Things](https://www.worldslargestthings.com/index.htm) (WLCoWSVoWLT).

The WLCoWSVoWLT is more than just a collection, it's a sideshow-painted Ford Econoline van-turned-traveling-museum full of miniature versions of roadside America attractions.

**Erika Nelson**, artist and director of WLCoWSVoWLT, is the mastermind behind this magical mobile menagerie of roaming replicas. She often tours the country, seeking out and documenting the oversized kitschy Americana that we can all be proud of. Erika speaks at art schools, universities, art commissions, and is a [consultant](https://www.worldslargestthings.com/scheduleavisit.htm) for cities and Chamber of Commerce who are looking to improve their local skyline with a gigantic fiberglass (or steel, or wood, or whatever) thing.

## Think big by thinking tiny

Although she encourages people to think big, Erika knows how to think tiny. Not only does Erika understand the concept of Balsa Man, she loves it. Unfortunately, Erika and her collection will be unable to attend the event; however, she has offered to send on-loan **THE WORLD'S SMALLEST VERSION of The World's Largest Collection of the World's Smallest Versions of the World's Largest Things!** (seen below).

This marks Balsa Man's first official tiny art car! _Of course, this on-loan miniature van will have to register with the **Department of Minute Vehicles**__._

Along with this minute museum Ericka has offered a donation to the [Black Pebble Arts Foundation](https://balsaman.org/donate/) in the form of a crisp **$2** bill!

_**Thanks Erika!**_

PS: [She also teaches kids how to sculpt things out of SPAM](https://www.flickr.com/photos/topekalibrary/sets/72157601128847553/). _She is our people._

## UPDATE:

WLCoWSVoWLT is Balsa Man's first interstate piece of art and the BPAF recognizes the daunting task of shipping art across the country. Thus, we are proud to award Erika Nelson tiny transportation & shipping art grant of to cover all postage to and from the event!

Erika's grant proposal was excellent as it contained an actual size version of the World's Smallest Version of the WLCoWSVoWLT.
