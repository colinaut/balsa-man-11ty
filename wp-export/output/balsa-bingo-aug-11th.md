It's the first ever Balsa Man Bingo! Don't have a ticket to this year's Balsa Man? What to get on the special location announcement list. **_This is your chance!_**

Due to the new ticketing rules, only ticket holders get on the location announcement list; if you do not yet have a ticket, you must either be an artist and [submit an art grant](http://balsaman.org/tiny-art-grants/) or come to one of the Ticket Casino Events. The Balsa Bingo Event is the first such event (others are TBD). For more read our [Updated Ticket & Location Announcement Policy](http://balsaman.org/2012/08/updated-ticket-location-announcement-policy/).
