_**NOTE:**_ _[Tiny Art](https://balsaman.org/tiny-art-grants/) Placement is not finalized and is shown for example only. Due to space limitations, all Balsa Man theme camp placement requests have been rejected. [Participants](https://balsaman.org/participate/) standing towards the back must be careful of the ocean as there is no life guard on duty and the water is cold (see [Balsa Man Survival Guide](https://balsaman.org/2009/07/balsa-man-survival-guide/))_
