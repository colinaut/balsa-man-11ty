Far from the cool, sandy shores of San Francisco, the [Black Rock Desert](http://blackrockdesert.org/) in Nevada is called home by many artistically inspired individuals. While this alkali desert is far away, ideas have a power to reach farther and faster than any Cruise America RV could ever hope.

And it is this small idea—the tiny yet wonderous idea of Balsa Man—which has flown across state lines, through Donner Pass, past the garish lights of the Peppermill Casino and taken root in the mind of at least one dust-covered creative soul.

We are pround to announce the first…

**Host: Ardent Heavy Industries** (at 4:00 and Adapt) **Date: Friday, September 4th (Labor Day Weekend)** **Time: 5 to 6 pm**

### Join your fellow lovers of all things tiny at the Black Rock Desert!

Are you driving all the way up to the middle of nowhere in the Nevada desert, with _nothing to do_? Do you have a [tiny art](http://balsaman.org/tiny-art-grants/) piece that would be perfect at Balsa Man but can't make it all the way to the main event in San Francisco? Then head over to the official Black Rock Desert Balsa Man Regional!

Tiny Artists and other participants are welcome, email [BRDregional@balsaman.org](mailto:BRDregional@balsaman.org) for more details.

## Kristen Ankiewicz, Balsa Regional Lead & Czarina of Tiny Art

![Your fearless Black Rock Desert Regional Lead for the Balsa Man Tiny Art Festival.](/images/158_0734.jpg "Kristen")[](http://monsters.net) [Kristen Ankiewicz](http://monsters.net) will be taking the helm as Balsa Man Regional Lead and Czarina of Tiny Art.

It seems that tiny art leads to big titles. This is all of course in addition to being in her own right artist extraordinaire and mastermind behind the cute and tiny monstrosities all for show at her site [Monsters.net](http://www.monsters.net). You can find her at **Camp Ardent Heavy Industries (4:00 and Adapt)** for other questions.

I, your humble guest Balsa Blogger will be another Balsa Man Tiny Art Festival — Black Rock Desert Regional Contact. (see what we mean about long titles?) I will be camping with Rathskellar, placement as yet to be determined.

If you will be missing out on the Balsa Burn on Saturday, September 5th in San Francisco, because you'll be up at that _other_ playa then come on over to Ardent and party with us on Friday.

And please, apply for a [tiny art grant](http://balsaman.org/tiny-art-grants/) to bring some tiny art to the first Black Rock Desert, Balsa Man Regional

## Balsa Man Regional call for artists!

The Balsa Man Black Rock Desert Regional does not yet have a central figure! Kristen is looking for artists who would like to build the BRD Balsa Regional's "Balsa Man" effigy. The central figure does not have to mimic the original "Balsa Man" but it should be inspiring. If you would like to build the BRD Balsa Regional's central figure please contact [BRDRegional@balsaman.org](mailto:BRDRegional@balsaman.org)
