[![Balsa Man Japan](/images/Balsa-Man-Japan2.png "Balsa Man Japan")](https://balsaman.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Balsa-Man-Japan2.png)Our Japanese counterparts have launched their own [Balsa Man Japan](https://www.burninja.info/balsaman/index.htm) website! Their regional burn will be happening on **August 29th at 5pm**. The location will be announced one week prior to the event on the 22nd.

Tiny artists and DTW volunteers are asked to show up early for set up. The **Balsa Man Japan burns at sunset** with other tiny art burning shortly thereafter—balsa burns in a blink of an eye so be on time! Clean up will begin after all tiny art is burned (around 8pm). Balsa Man is a **Leave No Trace** event so please help the DTW with their clean up efforts.

More information can be found on the [Balsa Man Japan Survival Guide](https://www.burninja.info/balsaman/survival.htm).
