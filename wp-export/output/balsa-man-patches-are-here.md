This year’s patch celebrates the theme _On Display!_ Patches can be bought directly at the [Oakland Museum Store](https://museumca.org/omca-store) or online below. 50% of all proceeds go to support the Oakland Museum of California!

_All official Balsa Man volunteers get a patch!_ If you are interested in volunteering for Balsa man contact us at [info@balsaman.org](mailto:info@balsaman.org).

Check out our [History of Balsa Man](https://balsaman.org/history/) page to see the emblems used for all the prior year patches!
