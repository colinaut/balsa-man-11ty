## Arrival Information

We encourage all to arrive by **6pm on Sept 5th** to view the [tiny art](http://balsaman.org/tiny-art-grants/) and mingle with the other Balsa Man [Participants](http://balsaman.org/participate/)—don't be late because Balsa Man is as short as it is tiny.

**Early arrival time** for Balsa Man volunteers and Tiny Artists is 5:15pm. Participants may actually arrive as early as they want; however, Basla Man DPW has the right to ridicule those who arrive way too early for their own good. It should be noted that there is _no camping._

There are **no tickets to Balsa Man**; however, you are welcome to create your own Balsa Man tickets.

Your car will not be searched at the gate, nor your person—in fact there isn't really even a gate. However, we encourage **Balsa Man Greeters**. Also, we need volunteers to create this year's [Balsa Burma Shave signs](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jhrphotos/2814562813/).

For event location information please contact [info@balsaman.org](mailto:info@balsaman.org).

## Departure Decorum

Our location closes 1 hour after sunset (7:33p); as a result, **Balsa Man ends at 8:33pm**. Please be prepared to clean up and leave shortly after the Balsa Man event is over.

Balsa Man is a **Leave No Trace** event. Please pack your trash out and do your part by helping the artists and organizers clean up after the event is over.

**Drive safe!** If you choose to drink at Balsa Man make sure to **_plan for a designated driver ahead of time_**. Also, do not twitter and drive! If you must tweet about how much you enjoyed Balsa Man, tweet before you begin driving.

## Beach Survival

Balsa Man participants should bring all necessities they need to survive a few hours on the beach. Balsa Man guidelines for beach survival are:

- It can get a mite chilly so bring a **jacket** and **maybe gloves and a hat**.
- Once the sun sets, it'll get dark so bring a **flashlight**.
- You might want to bring a **drink or a snack**.
- There is **no lifeguard on duty**.

_And lastly…_
