Jeff Ross, founder and director of the [SF Indie Fest](https://www.sfindie.com/), has promised a $10 matching donation to the Â [Black Pebble Arts Foundation](https://balsaman.org/donate/) for the next donor who donates $10 or more! Remember donations are used to fund [tiny art grants](https://balsaman.org/tiny-art-grants/) for our wonderful tiny artists.

**Well that was fast! We have already received our $10 donation. Congratulations donor your donation has been doubled!**

**_[Be the next donor!](https://balsaman.org/donate/)_**

> "\[BPAF is\] actually pretty neat, fund art on an affordable scale" ~ Jeff Ross
