## Balsa Man Regional call for artists!

The Balsa Man Black Rock Desert Regional does not yet have a central figure! Kristen is looking for artists who would like to build the BRD Balsa Regional's "Balsa Man" effigy. The central figure does not have to mimic the original "Balsa Man" but it should be inspiring. If you would like to build the BRD Balsa Regional's central figure please contact [BRDRegional@balsaman.org](mailto:BRDRegional@balsaman.org)

_Also, don't forget about the [Oakland Tiny Art Build Party](https://balsaman.org/2009/08/tiny-art-build-party-oakland-aug-22nd/) this Saturday from noon to 7pm._
