Balsa Man may be a short event but that doesn't mean you shouldn't pack the essentials. Of course, you could easily pack everything in your hipster messenger bag, your purse, or your murse. However, a true tiny artist packs with flair. For this reason, the BPAF art grant review committee is more than happy to award [**Twirlerette**](https://twitter.com/twirlerette) with an art grant of **$5** for her tiny art project **Tiny Luggage, _to carry tiny art_.**

**_Please note, in no way were we swayed by the absolutely adorable "OMG aren't they so freak'n cute!" prairie dogs chilling with the Balsa Man._**
