This completely beautiful and well designed grant proposal came to us all the way from Minneapolis, MN! Sadly, **Cali Mastny** won't be able to bring her **Tiny Star Tree** to Balsa Man as it's a bit farâ€”she'd only able to make it to the regional event in Black Rock Desert.

We wish her well in the dust of the desert and the BPAF is very proud to award her **$5** for to make her Tiny Star Tree a reality!
