This proposal was noticeably much longer than the 100–200 word limit\* we have set in the guidelines for grant proposals; so much so that the BPAF grant committee nearly cast it aside immediately. Fortunately, one member made a motion to "at least glean it." After a quick perusal, we composed the following list of choice words:

- _"misc tiny combustables"_
- _"neighborhood"_
- _"The Forged City"_
- _"transformed by fire"_

The BPAF grant committee vote was unanimous with most agreeing that the quoted words fit perfectly with the Balsa Man event, and one member who voted yes purely on the quality of the paper stock (Strathmore Imperial Watercolor 140lb Cold Press).

As a result, the Black Pebble Arts Foundation is proud to announce it's first tiny art grant award of **$5** to **Nara Brados** for her project **Tiny Bed of Roses!**

**\*UPDATE TO GRANT GUIDELINES: As a direct result of this proposal, the BPAF has now revised their grant proposal guidelines and the word limit is now 100–150 words in order to reduce eyestrain and work place injuries.**
