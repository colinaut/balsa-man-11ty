Here's a couple bits of tiny art inspiration to get your creative juices flowing for this year's Balsa Man!

## [![World’s Smallest Postal Service](/images/small-postal.jpg "World’s Smallest Postal Service")](http://sf.funcheap.com/313-410-worlds-tiniest-post-office/?utm_source=FuncheapSF+Email+Newsletter&utm_campaign=8620dce129-Weekly_Events_List_2010-03-12&utm_medium=email)World's Smallest Postal Service

The World’s Smallest Postal Service (WSPS) is a teeny tiny transcription service and roaming post office. Artist Lea Redmond is the Postmaster, setting up her tiny mobile office in cafes and shops where passers-by can write a letter and have it turned into a “world’s smallest letter.”

Your letter is transcribed on a miniature desk in the tiniest of script, sealed with a miniscule wax seal with the sender’s initial pressed into it, packaged up with a magnifying glass in a glassine envelope, and finished off with a large wax seal. It is a double delight: for both the sender and the recipient.

_**When:**_ Saturday, March 13th from 2pm to 6pm **Where:** The Curiosity Shoppe – 855 Valencia Street (twn 19th & 20th) – SF **Cost:** Free to watch letters being made, $8 to order your own.

## Miniature cities on household objects

The senior thesis exhibition, at the [Kyoto University of Art and Design](http://www.kyoto-art.ac.jp/)has some amazing small works on display which perfectly fit into this year's theme, "[The Forged Village](http://balsaman.org/2010/02/balsa-man-2010-theme-announcement/)." I wish I could go to Kyoto myself and see these wonderfully detailed cities atop common household objects.
