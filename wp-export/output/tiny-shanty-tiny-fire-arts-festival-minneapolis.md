[![Tiny Shanty sign](/images/4325785719_ff391ebfd7_b-e1265182368129.jpg "Tiny Shanty sign")](http://balsaman.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/4325785719_ff391ebfd7_b.jpg)Celebrating all that is small, the [**Tiny Shanty Project**](http://tinyshanty.wordpress.com) will be hosting the first ever Tiny Fire Arts festival in Minneapolis, MN on the beautiful frozen Medicine Lake! The Tiny Festival will mark the end of the amazing [Art Shanty Projects](http://www.artshantyprojects.org) which the Tiny Shanty was apart. The Tiny Fire Arts Festival also marks what is the first of many Balsa Regionals to happen in 2010!

**Sunday February 7th, dusk**

_A tiny art festival dedicated to the great art of small proportions. Take a stroll through our tiny (frozen) garden of art, and then join us for the burn. We will set afire an approximately two foot tall figure of art, appropriate to Minnesota, as well as any other tiny art people would like to burn._

**Tiny Shanty** itself is a lovely minute mansion out on the ice. The inside of the shanty is cozy and also doubles as a gallery space for a number of tiny art pieces contained within it's walls. It was crafted by an amazing [team of artists](http://www.flickr.com/photos/starfive/4325825475/) including the fabulous Balsa Man tiny artist and tiny grant recipient **Cali Mastny**, aka Star5, who crafted the beautiful [**Tiny Star Tree**](http://balsaman.org/2009/09/tiny-art-grant-award-tiny-star-tree/)!

The Tiny Star Tree is especially significant as it was the only piece of tiny art to appear at both the [Black Rock Balsa Regional](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rubin110/3927017891/) and the main [Balsa Man event](http://www.flickr.com/photos/strangepuppy/3854079292/in/pool-balsaman2009)! All of us here at the Balsa Man organization are thrilled to see such a talented tiny artist go on to produce such hugely diminutive art!

I myself, Colin Fahrion, am overjoyed as I will be heading out to Minneapolis this Friday to take part in the wonder of the Tiny Shanty and the Tiny Fire Arts Festival! Stay tuned to the Balsa Blog as I will be writing about my experience and plan on interviewing Cali and the rest of the Tiny Shanty team!

_Also, rumor has it that a special press conference is planned this weekend in Minneapolis where the **Balsa Man 2010 theme** may possibly be announced!_
